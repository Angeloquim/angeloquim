My name is Angelo Quim C. Malabanan. I am 20 years old. I was born on May 6, 1999 here in Manila, Phillippines and raised in Batangas, Philippines but half
of my life was spent studying abroad. After graduating High School, I tried to pursue SHS and College in Philippines and with that I took
the USTET suprisingly I passed both USTET for SHS and college. As of now, I'm pursuing the degree Bachelor of Science in Electonics 
Engineering.
